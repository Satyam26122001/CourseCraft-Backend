# CourseCraft - Backend

The backend is built using Java and Spring Boot. It provides REST APIs for user authentication, course management, and profile handling. JWT-based authentication is used for securing endpoints.

## Tech Stack

This was developed as a collaborative team project.

In this project, I mainly worked on the frontend part of the application. I was responsible for:

- Building the UI using React.js

This repository is a fork of the original team repository.
